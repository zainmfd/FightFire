# De-merits of existing solution

* Most of the existing solutions will alert after the burning of woods, this will kill lots of animals and plants, and this leads to the extinction of animals and plants.
* Most of the Solutions can only retrieve coordinates of the affected area and can't help in the rescue mission.
* All the existing systems can't identify the weather condition of the land area before the origin of the fire.
* Evacuation of leaving beings in the hazardous area will be a major complication.
